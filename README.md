I. Liscense 

	This code is distributed under the Beerware liscense. Any individual is free to do as they please with
	this source under the condition that if they ever meet the author and they like the code, then they 
	buy him a beer. 

II. Description

	This code was written and tested for use with the Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout Board. The library
	gathers latitude, and longitude in decimal format, not NMEA minute format. Initializing the GPS and
	parsing the information was designed to be straightforward and is demonstrated in the example code.
	The example code uses the USART library from the book "MAKE: AVR Programming" by Elliot Williams.
